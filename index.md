## Welcome!
This is the official PHP library for communicating with the [MonkeyPod](https://monkeypod.io) API. 

The SDK provides useful abstractions of many core MonkeyPod resources. If you use it, you can probably avoid ever messing around with the underlying API documentation. If you do need to consult that "raw" API documentation, it can be found in the 
[MonkeyPod Knowledgebase](https://monkeypod.helpscoutdocs.com/category/134-api?sort=).
