## Laravel
This library uses a few components from the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) framework, 
but it can be used with or without Laravel. If you do use Laravel, there is a test 
helper that allows you to make API calls using Laravel's test HTTP client. This could 
be useful if you need to mock the MonkeyPod API server locally.
